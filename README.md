## What is this?
This is a tiny maze game, using Prim's algorithm to generate a random maze.
I've used Windows Forms for drawing.

## How to build?
Have .Net version >= 4.6.1 installed.
Download project and import the .sln file in the main directory.
Tested with Visual Studio 2015/17.

## How to use?
W, A, S, D, and corresponding arrow keys to move the player character around.
You finish the game if you touch the exit tile.
